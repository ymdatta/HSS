<h2 id="org8450ba4"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> The 'Promise'</h2>
<ul>
<li>C. Wright Mills says that the The sociological imagination enables us
to grasp history and biography and the relations between the two 
within society. That is its task and its promise.</li>

<li>Sociological Imagination can also be defined as "the vivid awareness
of the relationship between personal experience and wider society".</li>

<section id="slide-orgcacd883">
<h2 id="orgcacd883"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Asking the 'right' questions</h2>
<p>
Mills says that these are the types of questions that should be raised
by any mind possessing social imagination. These fall into three
categories.
</p>

<p>
Asking right questions help us to shift from one perspective to another
perspective - from political to psychological, from examination of single
family to comparitive assesments of national budgets of world etc.
</p>

<p>
It is the capacity to range from the most impersonal and remote
transformations to the most intimate features of human self - and
to see the relations between the two.

<h2 id="orgcdf47b0"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Trouble vs Issues</h2>
<p>
Mills says that the most fruitful distinction with which the sociological
imagination works is between <i><b>the personal troubles of milieu</b></i> and 
<i><b>the public issues of social structure</b></i>.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org6a03295">
<h3 id="org6a03295"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Troubles:</h3>
<p>
A Trouble is a private matter: values cherished by an individual are
felt by him to be threatened.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org1bfe213">
<h3 id="org1bfe213"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Issues:</h3>
<p>
An issue is a public matter: values cherished by public is felt to be
threatened.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org73570ed">
<h3 id="org73570ed"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Obesity in America - Is it an issue or trouble (1):</h3>
<ul>
<li>According to center of disease control, 35% (34.9% to be preicse) of 
adults are obese and 69% (68.5% to be precise) are either obese or 
overweight.</li>

<li>Social structures that contribute to obesity include <b><span class="underline">Food Desertes</span></b>,
which are areas of U.S where people donot have access to healthy foods
like fruits etc and these are also the places where we cannot grow these
types of foods. So little access to healthy foods.</li>

<li>Governament subsidies: Research shows &lt;1% goes towards the fresh fruits 
or vegetables while majority of subsidies are given to <b>Meat, Diary and
grain</b> production.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org6d80908">
<h3 id="org6d80908"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Obesity in America - Is it an issue or trouble (2):</h3>
<ul>
<li>This basically makes vegetables costlier compared to Meat etc. This leads
to more people consuming heavy foods, in these areas it now becomes
an <b><span class="underline">issue</span></b>.</li>

<li>In other areas(i am generalising here not taking many factors) it is more
of a private trouble.</li>

<h3 id="org34bbc72"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> <b><span class="underline">Well being</span></b> :</h3>
<p>
People experience this when they have some set of 'values' and do not
feel any threat to them.
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgfd1fbab">
<h3 id="orgfd1fbab"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> <b><span class="underline">Crisis</span></b> :</h3>
<p>
People experience this when they cherish values but do feel them to be
'threatened', they experience a crisis - either a personal value or
public issue.
</p>

<p>
Ex: People in the LGBT community feel threatened and experience 'crisis'.
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-orge5b82bb">
<h3 id="orge5b82bb"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> <b><span class="underline">Indifference</span></b>:</h3>
<p>
People experience this when they are neither aware of any cherished values
nor experience any threat.
</p>

<p>
If this involves all their values, it becomes <b>apathy</b>.
</p>

<p>
The question of apathy has come up in India again and again, cases where

man and lay dead in a pool of blood for two hours while people went about

<section id="slide-org57cac50">
<h3 id="org57cac50"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> <b><span class="underline">Uneasiness</span></b>:</h3>
<p>
People experience this when they are unaware of any cherished values but 
experience threat.
</p>

<p>
Ex: How we felt when Trump decided to build a 'border wall' between
Mexico and U.S.A.
