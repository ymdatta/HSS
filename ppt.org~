#+TITLE: Sociological Imagination
* The 'Promise'
  - C. Wright Mills says that the The sociological imagination enables us
    to grasp history and biography and the relations between the two 
    within society. That is its task and its promise.

  - Sociological Imagination can also be defined as "the vivid awareness
    of the relationship between personal experience and wider society".
* Various 'states' of people
** *_Well being_* :
   People experience this when they have some set of 'values' and do not
   feel any threat to them.
** *_Crisis_* :
   People experience this when they cherish values but do feel them to be
   'threatened', they experience a crisis - either a personal value or
   public issue.

   Ex: People in the LGBT community feel threatened and experience 'crisis'.
** *_Indifference_*:
   People experience this when they are neither aware of any cherished values
   nor experience any threat.

   If this involves all their values, it becomes *apathy*.
** *_Uneasiness_*:
   People experience this when they are unaware of any cherished values but 
   experience threat.

   Ex: How we felt when Trump decided to build a 'border wall' between
   Mexico and U.S.A.
